# Custom UI Templates

As a platform operator, you can provide a fully branded certificate experience by building custom templates. A custom template controls the entire look and behaviour of the certificate page for certificates issued through your Bootstrap Datum.

Full documentation, including the CLI scaffold, the Template class API, theming, and Docker deployment, is in the [Custom Templates](../templates) section.

The key connection to your platform setup: set `VITE_ADDITIONAL_TEMPLATES` when deploying the frontend, and register the template ID in your Bootstrap Datum's `token_name` field so it activates automatically for your users.
